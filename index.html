    <h2>Avoid Simple Passwords</h2>
    <img class="top-image" src="article1.jpg" alt="Avoid Simple Passwords">
    <div class="article-text">
      <h3>About the Topic</h3>
      <p>Passwords are often the first and sometimes the only line of defense in digital security. In many cases, users opt for convenience over security and choose simple, easily guessable passwords such as "123456", "password", or even parts of their names. These simple choices provide little to no protection against cyber threats.</p>
      <img class="section-image" src="placeholder1.jpg" alt="Password Security">
      <h3>Why is this a Problem?</h3>
      <p>When attackers use automated tools to try out common passwords, they can gain access to accounts in minutes. The consequences of a breach include stolen personal information, unauthorized transactions, and further intrusion into connected systems. Simple passwords are a weak link in your overall security strategy.</p>
      <img class="section-image" src="placeholder2.jpg" alt="Security Breach">
      <h3>How to Fix it?</h3>
      <p>To improve your security, always create strong, unique passwords. A robust password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, consider using a reliable password manager that can generate complex passwords and store them securely, so you don’t have to remember each one.</p>

    <span class="close-btn" onclick="closeArticle(9)">Close</span>
    <h2>Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
    <img class="top-image" src="article9.jpg" alt="Enable Two-Factor Authentication">
    <div class="article-text">
      <h3>About the Topic</h3>
      <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This additional step makes it much more difficult for attackers to compromise your accounts.</p>
      <img class="section-image" src="placeholder1.jpg" alt="2FA">
      <h3>Why is this a Problem?</h3>
      <p>Even strong passwords can be compromised through phishing, data breaches, or keylogging. Without a second factor, attackers only need one piece of information to gain access to your sensitive accounts.</p>
      <img class="section-image" src="placeholder2.jpg" alt="Account Security">
      <h3>How to Fix it?</h3>
      <p>Enable 2FA on every account that supports it, using an authenticator app or hardware token for the most secure method. This greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.</p>
